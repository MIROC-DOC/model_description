atmosphere near the earth's surface. It is stability and density. \(h\)
is an indicator of the sub-grid surface elevation change, Assume that
the standard deviation of the surface elevation is equal to \(Z_{SD}\).

Here, the local fluid number at the surface If
\((F_L)_{1/2} = N_1 Z_{SD}/U_1\) is the critical fluid number When you
