# Model Overview.

## Characteristics of CCSR/NIES AGCM

AGCM5.4 was developed in collaboration with the Center for Climate System Research (CCSR) at the University of Tokyo.
Prepared in collaboration with the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) ,
A global three-dimensional general circulation model of the atmosphere.
The characteristics of the model are listed below.
