## Basic Settings.

Here we present the basic setup of the model.

### Coordinate System.

The coordinate system is basically,
Longitude $\lambda$, Latitude $\varphi$, Normalized Pressure $\sigma = p/p_S$
($p_S(\lambda,\varphi)$ are surface pressure.)
and treat each as orthogonal.
However, $z$ is used as the vertical coordinates.

Longitude is discretized at equal intervals `MODULE:[ASETL]`.

$$
  \lambda_i = 2 \pi \frac{i-1}{I}  \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots I-1
$$


Latitude is the Gauss latitude $\varphi_j$ described in Mechanics, and `MODULE:[ ASETL]`,
Gauss-Legendre derived from the integral formula.
This takes $\mu = \sin \varphi$ as its argument
J The zero point of the next Legendre polynomial `MODULE:[GAUSS]`.

If J is large, we can approximate

$$
  \varphi_j =  \pi ( \frac{1}{2}- \frac{j-1/2}{J} ) \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots J-1
$$


Normally, the grid spacing of longitude and latitude is taken as $J = I/2$ almost equally.
This is based on the triangular truncation of the spectral method.

Normalized atmospheric pressure ($\sigma$) is designed to give a good representation of the vertical structure of the atmosphere,
suitably discretized at unequal intervals `MODULE:[ASETS]`.
As we will discuss later in Mechanics, the value of the layer boundaries
Define the $\sigma_{k-1/2}$ in $k = 1 \ldots K+1$ and then ,

$$
 \sigma_k = \left\{ \frac{1}{1+\kappa}
                     \left( \frac{  \sigma^{\kappa +1}_{k-1/2}
                                  - \sigma^{\kappa +1}_{k+1/2}      }
                                  { \sigma_{k-1/2} - \sigma_{k+1/2} }
                     \right)
              \right\}^{1/\kappa}
$$


Find the $\sigma$ representing the layer by
Figure [a-setup:level\]] (#a-setup:level), with the standard Indicates the level of the 20 layers used.

Each forecast variable is all, $(\lambda_i, \varphi_j, \sigma_k)$
or defined on the grid of $(\lambda_i, \varphi_j, z_l)$.
(The underground level, $z_l$, is discussed in the Physical Processes section.)

In the time direction, they are discretized at equally spaced $\Delta t$,
The time integration of the forecasting equation is performed.
However, if the stability of the time integration may be compromised
$\Delta t$ can change.
