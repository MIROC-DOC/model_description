### Basic Equations.

The fundamental equations are a system of primitive equations at the spherical (TERM00191,TERM00191) and TERM00192 coordinates, given as follows ( Haltiner and Williams , 1980 ).

1. a series of equations

         EQ=00008.

2. hydrostatic pressure formula

         EQ=00009.

3. equation of motion

         EQ=00010.

         EQ=00011.

4. thermodynamic equation

         EQ=00016.
         EQ=00016.

5. water vapor formula

         EQ=00017.
         EQ=00017.

Here,

     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.
     EQ=00018.

TERM00197 and TERM00197 are horizontal diffusion terms, TERM00198 and TERM00198 are forces due to small-scale kinetic processes (treated as 'physical processes'), TERM00199 are forces due to radiation, condensation, small-scale kinetic processes, etc. Heating and temperature change due to 'physical processes', and TERM00200 is a water vapor source term due to 'physical processes' such as condensation and small-scale motion. TERM00201 is the heat of friction and

     EQ=00012.

TERM00204 is a time-varying term of TERM00205 and TERM00205 due to horizontal and vertical diffusion.

### Boundary Conditions.

The boundary conditions for lead-direct current are

     EQ=00013.

Therefore, from (14), we can calculate the time variation of surface pressure and the vertical velocity of the TERM00206 system. Therefore, from (14), the equation for the time variation of surface pressure and the diagnostic equation for vertical velocity (TERM00207) in the TERM00206 system

     EQ=00014.

     EQ=00015.

is led.
