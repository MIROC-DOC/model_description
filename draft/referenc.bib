               choose which absorption bands to include. The last is an upgrade
               of the optimization method used to decrease the number of
               quadrature points used for numerical integration in the
               correlated k-distribution approach, thereby realizing higher
               computational efficiency without losing accuracy. The new
               radiation package termed ``mstrnX'' computes radiation fluxes
               and heating rates with errors less than 0.6W/m2 and 0.3K/day,

  author    = "Arakawa, Akio and Konor, Celal S",
  abstract  = "AbstractTwo types of vertical grids are used for atmospheric
               models: the Lorenz grid (L grid) and the Charney--Phillips grid
               (CP grid). Although the CP grid is the standard grid for
               quasigenstrophic models, it is not widely used in the primitive
               equation models because it is easier with the L grid to maintain
               some of the integral properties of the continuous system.In this
               paper, problems with the L grid are pointed out that are due to
               the existence of an extra degree of freedom in the vertical
               distribution of the temperature (and the potential temperature).
               Then a vertical differencing of the primitive equations based on
               the CP grid is presented, while most of the advantages of the L
               grid in a hybrid $\sigma$--p vertical coordinate are maintained.
               The discrete hydrostatic equation is constructed in such a way
               that it is free from the vertical computational mode in the
               thermal field. Also, the vertical advection of the potential
               temperature in the discrete thermodynamic equation is
               constructed in such a way that it reduces to the standard (and
               most straightforward) vertical differencing of the
               quasigeostrophic equations based on the CP grid.Simulations of
               standing oscillations superposed on a resting atmosphere are
               presented using two vertically discrete models, one based on the
               L grid and the other on the CP grid. The comparison of the
               simulations shows that with the L grid a stationary vertically
               zigzag pattern dominates in the thermal field, while with the CP
               grid no such pattern is evident. Simulations of the growth of an
               extratropical cyclone in a cyclic channel on a $\beta$ plane are
               also presented using two different $\sigma$-coordinate models,
               again one with the L grid and the other with the CP grid,
               starting from random disturbances. The L grid simulation is
               dominated by short waves, while there is no evidence of
               short-wave growth in the CP grid simulation.",

  title     = "Development and Application of a Prognostic Cumulus
               Parametrization",
  author    = "Pan, Dzong-Ming",
  abstract  = "The Arakawa-Schubert cumulus parameterization assumes a
               quasi-equilibrium between the cumulus convection and the
               ``large-scale forcing.'' It is, however, not very clear that it
               is always possible to distinctly separate the ``non-convective
               processes'' from the convective processes. We therefore propose
               a prognostic approach for implementing the Arakawa-Schubert
               parameterization. This approach bypasses the ambiguity in
               separating the large-scale forcing from the cumulus convection,
               and may be the first step toward improving the interactions
               between parameterized physics in large-scale numerical models.
               The simplified calculation allows more physics of convection,
               such as downdrafts, to be taken into account. The prognostic CKE
               approach was tested in a one -dimensional model to simulate
               observations from the GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Program)
               Atlantic Tropical Experiment. We can successfully simulate the
               time evolution of the precipitation rate and the vertical
               distribution of the cumulus heating rate. The disposable
               parameter, alpha, that relates the CKE with the cloud-base mass
               flux is tested with two different values. Results indicate that
               one value of alpha produces a better time evolution, while the
               other generates a more realistic vertical structure of the
               heating rate. This may be due to the fact that we have used only
               one alpha for all cloud types. According to the relation derived
               from the definitions of CKE and cloud -base mass flux, alpha
               should be a function of cloud depth. We tested the prognostic
               CKE approach with the Colorado State University general
               circulation model. It was found that the model produces much
               higher anvil incidence which dramatically reduces the absorbed
               solar radiation in the tropics. A ``fractional coverage'' has
               been introduced in the simple anvil parameterization. We then
               found improvements in the January precipitation over land. The
               detrainment-level height, p, was chosen by Lord (1978) to define
               cloud types for the cloud model. Lord's approach has proven
               incompatible with the CKE approach. We therefore replace p with
               the fractional entrainment rate, lambda. With this approach,
               lambda is an independent variable and the value of alpha should
               depend on Deltalambda and the model's vertical resolution.
               lambda also appears to be a physically more reasonable
               identifier for cloud types.",

               of environmental entrainment and updraft detrainment rates. In
               particular, the two-way exchange of mass between clouds and
               their environment is modulated at each vertical level by a
               buoyancy sorting mechanism at the interface of clear and cloudy
               air. The new entrainment/detrainment scheme allows vertical
               profiles of both updraft moisture detrainment and updraft
               vertical mass flux to vary in a physically realistic way as a

               the model to that which would obtain in a state of local
               equilibrium. The Level 2.5 model is reasonably accurate over the

               some of its physical shortcomings for that case, and to remove
               the pathologies that prohibit its use in a general circulation
               model. The modified model attempts to take into account the
               effects of the growth rate, advection and vertical turbulent
               diffusion terms in the balance equations for all of the second

               various other modified versions of the model through the
               numerical simulation of a growing convective planetary boundary
               layer. The modified Level 2.5 model gives a realistic-looking
               simulation of the evolution of the second turbulent moments at
               the 300 m level. The scheme approaches the same asymptotic state
               as does the turbulent kinetic energy adjustment scheme, but the
               modified Level 2.5 model predicts a longer period of transience.
               The TKE-adjustment scheme reduces to the Level 2 model during

               suppresses the spurious computational mode associated with the
               leapfrog time-stepping scheme. Unfortunately, it also weakly
               suppresses the physical mode and severely degrades the numerical
               accuracy. These two concomitant problems are shown to occur
               because the filter does not conserve the mean state, averaged
               over the three time slices on which it operates. The author
               proposes a simple modification to the Robert--Asselin filter,

               the case in which a source injects condensate-laden, saturated

               general distribution of thermodynamic variables within the

               derived by assuming that condensate is added uniformly to both

               the local condensate mixing ratio associated with the condensate

               liquid and ice in clouds. We base our analysis on the ratio of
               ice condensates to the total condensates (phase ratio, PR). Its
               transition at 90\% (PR90) and its links with other relevant

               Product climatology, reanalysis data, and other satellite
               observations. In 13 of 16 models, the PR90 transition height
               occurs too low (6?km to 8.4?km) and at temperatures too warm
               (?13.9°C to ?32.5°C) compared to observations (8.6?km, ?33.7°C);
               features consistent with a lack of supercooled liquid with
               respect to ice above 6.5?km. However, this bias would be

  author    = "Wood, Robert and Bretherton, Christopher S",
  abstract  = "Abstract Observations in subtropical regions show that
               stratiform low cloud cover is well correlated with the
               lower-troposphere stability (LTS), defined as the difference in
               potential temperature $\vartheta$ between the 700-hPa level and
               the surface. The LTS can be regarded as a measure of the
               strength of the inversion that caps the planetary boundary layer
               (PBL). A stronger inversion is more effective at trapping
               moisture within the marine boundary layer (MBL), permitting
               greater cloud cover. This paper presents a new formulation,
               called the estimated inversion strength (EIS), to estimate the
               strength of the PBL inversion given the temperatures at 700 hPa
               and at the surface. The EIS accounts for the general observation
               that the free-tropospheric temperature profile is often close to
               a moist adiabat and its lapse rate is strongly temperature
               dependent. Therefore, for a given LTS, the EIS is greater at
               colder temperatures. It is demonstrated that while the seasonal
               cycles of LTS and low cloud cover fraction (CF) are strongly
               correlated in many regions, no single relationship between LTS
               and CF can be found that encompasses the wide range of
               temperatures occurring in the Tropics, subtropics, and
               midlatitudes. However, a single linear relationship between CF
               and EIS explains 83\% of the regional/seasonal variance in
               stratus cloud amount, suggesting that EIS is a more
               regime-independent predictor of stratus cloud amount than is LTS
               under a wide range of climatological conditions. The result has
               some potentially important implications for how low clouds might
               behave in a changed climate. In contrast to Miller's thermostat
               hypothesis that a reduction in the lapse rate
               (Clausius--Clapeyron) will lead to increased LTS and increased
               tropical low cloud cover in a warmer climate, the results here
               suggest that low clouds may be much less sensitive to changes in
               the temperature profile if the vertical profile of tropospheric
               warming follows a moist adiabat.",

               from a compilation of laboratory studies. This is the first time
               that freezing parameterizations take the chemical composition of
               ice nuclei into account. The rather subtle differences between

               significant implications for the anthropogenic indirect aerosol

               be composed of kaolinite or montmorillonite. In simulation KAO,
               black carbon has a higher relevancy as an ice nucleus than in

               anthropogenic aerosols results in a larger ice water path, a
               slightly higher precipitation rate, and a reduced total cloud
               cover. On the contrary, in simulation MON the increase in ice
               water path is much smaller and globally the decrease in

               flux of soil dust aerosols at the LGM is simulated to be about
               2.4 times as large as that in the present climate, and the
               simulated deposition flux is in general agreement with
               estimations from ice core and marine sediment samplings though
               it appears to be underestimated over the Antarctic. The
               calculated direct radiative forcings of soil dust aerosols at
               the LGM is close to zero at the tropopause and −0.4 W m−2 at the

               varies vertically depending on the surrounding environment. Two
               different formulations are examined for the rate. The cumulus
               ensemble is spectrally represented according to the updraft
               velocity at cloud base. Cloud-base mass flux is determined with
               prognostic convective kinetic energy closure. The entrainment
               rate tends to be large near cloud base because of the small
               updraft velocity near that level. Deep convection tends to be
               suppressed when convective available potential energy is small
               because of upward reduction of in-cloud moist static energy. Dry
               environmental air significantly reduces in-cloud humidity mainly
               because of the large entrainment rate in the lower troposphere,
               which leads to suppression of deep convection, consistent with
               observations and previous results of cloud-resolving models. The

  abstract  = "AbstractSubgrid snow cover is one of the key parameters in
               global land models since snow cover has large impacts on the
               surface energy and moisture budgets, and hence the surface
               temperature. In this study, the Subgrid Snow Distribution
               (SSNOWD) snow cover parameterization was incorporated into the
               Minimal Advanced Treatments of Surface Interaction and Runoff
               (MATSIRO) land surface model. SSNOWD assumes that the subgrid
               snow water equivalent (SWE) distribution follows a lognormal
               distribution function, and its parameters are physically derived
               from geoclimatic information. Two 29-yr global offline
               simulations, with and without SSNOWD, were performed while
               forced with the Japanese 25-yr Reanalysis (JRA-25) dataset
               combined with an observed precipitation dataset. The simulated
               spatial patterns of mean monthly snow cover fraction were
               compared with satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging
               Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. The snow cover fraction
               was improved by the inclusion of SSNOWD, particularly for the
               accumulation season and/or regions with relatively small amounts
               of snowfall; snow cover fraction was typically underestimated in
               the simulation without SSNOWD. In the Northern Hemisphere, the
               daily snow-covered area was validated using Interactive
               Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow analysis
               datasets. In the simulation with SSNOWD, snow-covered area
               largely agreed with the IMS snow analysis and the seasonal cycle
               in the Northern Hemisphere was improved. This was because SSNOWD
               formulates the snow cover fraction differently for the
               accumulation season and ablation season, and represents the
               hysteresis of the snow cover fraction between different seasons.
               The effects of including SSNOWD on hydrological properties and
               snow mass were also examined.",

               Research on Climate (MIROC), called MIROC6, was cooperatively
               developed by a Japanese modeling community. In the present
               paper, simulated mean climate, internal climate variability, and
               climate sensitivity in MIROC6 are evaluated and briefly
               summarized in comparison with the previous version of our
               climate model (MIROC5) and observations. The results show that
               the overall reproducibility of mean climate and internal climate
               variability in MIROC6 is better than that in MIROC5. The
               tropical climate systems (e.g., summertime precipitation in the
               western Pacific and the eastward-propagating Madden--Julian
               oscillation) and the midlatitude atmospheric circulation (e.g.,
               the westerlies, the polar night jet, and
               troposphere--stratosphere interactions) are significantly
               improved in MIROC6. These improvements can be attributed to the
               newly implemented parameterization for shallow convective
               processes and to the inclusion of the stratosphere. While there
               are significant differences in climates and variabilities
               between the two models, the effective climate sensitivity of 2.6
               K remains the same because the differences in radiative forcing
               and climate feedback tend to offset each other. With an aim
               towards contributing to the sixth phase of the Coupled Model

  abstract  = "Abstract Turbulence models centered on hypotheses by Rotta and
               Kolmogoroff are complex. In the present paper we consider
               systematic simplifications based on the observation that
               parameters governing the degree of anisotropy are small.
               Hopefully, we shall discern a level of complexity which is
               intuitively attractive and which optimizes computational speed
               and convenience without unduly sacrificing accuracy. Discussion
               is focused on density stratified flow due to temperature.
               However, other dependent variables?such as water vapor and
               droplet density?can be treated in analogous fashion. It is, in
               fact, the anticipation of additional physical complexity in
               modeling turbulent flow fields that partially motivates the
               interest in an organized process of analytical simplification.
               For the problem of a planetary boundary layer subject to a
               diurnally varying surface heat flux or surface temperature,
               three models of varying complexity have been integrated for 10
               days. All of the models incorporate identical empirical
               constants obtained from neutral flow data alone. The most
               complex of the three models requires simultaneous solution of 10
               partial differential equations for turbulence moments in
               addition to the equations for the mean velocity components and
               temperature; the least complex eliminates all of the 10
               differential equation whereas a ?compromise? model retains two
               differential equations for total turbulent energy and
               temperature variance. We conclude that all of the models give
               nearly the same results. We find the two-differential-equation
               model particularly attractive.",

              surface interaction and runoff (MATSIRO), has been developed for
              climate studies at the global and regional scales. The canopy has
              a single layer, whose albedo and bulk coefficients are evaluated
              on the basis of a multilayer canopy model. The fluxes are
              calculated from the energy balance at the ground and canopy
              surfaces in snow-free and snow-covered portions considering the
              subgrid snow distribution. The interception evaporation from
              canopy and the transpiration on the basis of photosynthesis are
              treated. A simplified TOPMODEL is used to calculate runoff. The
              snow has the variable number of layers from one to three in
              accordance with snow water equivalent (SWE), and the snow
              temperature is calculated by a thermal conduction equation.
              Besides, the snowmelt, the refreeze of snowmelt, and the freeze
              of rainfall in snow are taken into consideration. It is found in
              the PILPS 2e experiment that some parameters in the runoff
              scheme, such as the surface hydraulic conductivity and the river
              channel fraction, have a considerable impact on the partitioning
              of the surface runoff and the base flow. The snow albedo is
              prognosticated from the time passage since last snowfall and the
              snow temperature. The soil has five layers in this version, and
              the soil temperature, the soil moisture, and the frozen amount of
              moisture are calculated.",
