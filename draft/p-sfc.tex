\section{Surface Flux}\label{surface-flux}}

Until CCSR/NIES AGCM, both land surface and sea surface were treated as
one of the atmospheric physical processes, but after MIROC3
(\href{https://ccsr.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hasumi/miroc_description.pdf}{Hasumi
and Emori, 2004}), land surface processes became independent as MATSIRO.
However, since MIROC3
(\href{https://ccsr.aori.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~hasumi/miroc_description.pdf}{Hasumi
and Emori, 2004}), land surface processes have been separated into
MATSIRO. In \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}SURFCE{]}} in pgsfc.F,
\texttt{ENTRY:{[}OCNFLX{]}} (in \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}OCEAN{]}} of
pgocn.F) is called for the sea surface, and \texttt{ENTRY:{[}LNDFLX{]}}
(in \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}MATSIRO{]}} of matdrv.F) is called for the
land surface, respectively. This chapter describes sea surface
processes, which are still treated within the framework of atmospheric
physical processes (MIROC6). For the land surface processes, please
refer to
\href{https://github.com/integrated-land-simulator/model_description}{Description
of ILS}.

No progostic variables are used in this scheme.

\texttt{{[}OCNFLX{]}}}{Sea surface flux {[}OCNFLX{]}}}\label{sea-surface-flux-ocnflx}}

Sea surface processes provide the boundary conditions at the lower end
of the atmosphere through the exchange of momentum, heat, and water
fluxes between the atmosphere and the surface. In
\texttt{ENTRY:{[}OCNFLX{]}}, the following procedure is used to deal
with sea surface processes.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  prepare variables for sea ice extent and no ice extent, respectively,
  using sea ice concentration.
\item
  Determine the surface boundary conditions.
\item
  Calculate the flux balance.
\item
  Calculate the radiation budget at the sea surface.
\item
  Calculate the deposition by CHASER.
\item
  solve the heat balance at the sea surface and update the skin
  temperature and each flux value.
\end{enumerate}

Practically, precipitation flux from 2 schemes are treated together.

\begin{eqnarray}
    Pr = Pr_c + Pr_l
\end{eqnarray}

In the sea ice area (\(L=1\)), the skin temperature (\(T_s\)) is the sea
ice skin temperature (\(T_{ice}\)). However, if \(T_{ice}\) is higher
than \(T_{melt}=0\), then \(T_{melt}\) is used.

\begin{eqnarray}
    T_s = min(T_{ice},T_{melt})
\end{eqnarray}

The sea ice bottom temperature \(T_b\) is assumed to be the sea skin
temperature (\(T_{o(1)}\)).

\begin{eqnarray}
    T_b = T_{o(1)}
\end{eqnarray}

The amount of sea ice (\(W_{ice}\)) and the amount of snow on it
(\(W_{snow}\)) are converted per unit area by considering \(R_{ice}\)
and used in the calculation. However, a limiter (\(\epsilon\)) is
provided to prevent the values from becoming too small.

\begin{eqnarray}
R_{ice} =\mathrm{max}( R_{ice,orginal}, \epsilon)
\end{eqnarray}

In the ice-free region (\(L=2\)), the skin temperature (\(T_s\)) and sea
ice bottom temperature (\(T_b\)) are assumed to be the sea temperature
temperature (\(T_{o(1)}\)).

\begin{eqnarray}
    T_s = T_b = T_{o(1)}
\end{eqnarray}

The evaporation efficiency ise set to 1 for both \(L=1, 2\).

If the sea ice concentration (\(R_{ice}\)) is not given, it can be
diagnosed simply from the sea ice volume (\(W_{ice}\)) in
\texttt{ENTRY:{[}OCNICR{]}} (in \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}OCNICR{]}} of
pgocn.F).

\begin{eqnarray}
R_{ice} = \mathrm{min}\Big(\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{max}(W_{ice},0)}{W_{ice,c}}},1.0\Big)
\end{eqnarray}

The standard gives the amount of sea ice per area as
\(W_{ice,c}=300 \mathrm{[kg/m^2]}\).

\hypertarget{sea-surface-conditions-ocnbcs}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Sea Surface Conditions
\texttt{{[}OCNBCS{]}}}{Sea Surface Conditions {[}OCNBCS{]}}}\label{sea-surface-conditions-ocnbcs}}

In \texttt{ENTRY{[}OCNBCS{]}} (in \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}OCNSUB{]}} of
pgocn.F), surface albedo and roughness are calculated. They are
calculated supposing ice-free conditions, then modified.

First, let us consider the sea albedo. The sea level \(\alpha_{(d,b)}\),
\(b=1,2,3\) represent the visible, near-infrared, and infrared
wavelength bands, respectively. Also, \(d=1,2\) represents direct and
scattered light, respectively. The albedo for the visible bands are
calculated in \texttt{SUBROUTINE\ {[}SEAALB{]}} (of pgocn.F), supposing
ice-free conditions. The albedo for near-infrared is set to same as the
visible one. The albedo for infrared is uniformly set to a constant
value.

The grid-averaged albedo, taking into account the sea ice concentration
(\(R_{ice}\)), is

\begin{eqnarray}
    \alpha = \alpha -R_{ice} \alpha_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

\(\alpha_{ice}\) is given by the standard as
\(\alpha_{ice,1}=0.5,\alpha_{ice,2}=0.5,\alpha_{ice,3}=0.05\),
respectively.

In addition, we want to consider the effect of snow cover. Here, we
consider the albedo modification by temperature. The standard threshold
values for snow temperature are \(T_{al,2}=258.15 \mathrm{[K]}\) and
\(T_{al,1}=273.15 \mathrm{[K]}\). The snow albedo changes linearly with
temperature change from \(\alpha_{snow,1}=0.75\) to
\(\alpha_{ snow,2}\). Let the coefficient \(\tau_{snow}\), which is
\(0\le \tau \le 1\).

\begin{eqnarray}
\tau_{snow} = \frac{T_s - T_{al,1}}{T_{al,2}-T_{al,1}}
\end{eqnarray}

Update the snow albedo (\(\alpha_{snow}\)) as

\begin{eqnarray}
    \alpha_{snow} = \alpha_{snow,0} + \tau_{snow}(\alpha_{snow,2}-\alpha_{snow,1})
\end{eqnarray}

Second, let us consider the sea surface roughness. The roughnesses of
for momentum, heat and vapor are calculated in
\texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}SEAZ0F{]}} (of pgocn.F), supposing the ice-free
conditions.

When the sea ice exists (\(L=1\)), each roughness is modified to take
into account the sea concentration (\(R_{ice}\)),

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,M} = z_{0,M} + ( z_{0,ice,M} - z_{0,M})  R_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,H} = z_{0,H} + ( z_{0,ice,H} - z_{0,H})  R_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,E} = z_{0,E} + ( z_{0,ice,E} - z_{0,E})  R_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

where, \(r_{0,ice,*}\) is the roughness of sea ice for momentum, heat
and vapor, respectively.

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,M} = z_{0,M} + ( z_{0,snow,M} - z_{0,M})  R_{snow}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,H} = z_{0,H} + ( z_{0,snow,H} - z_{0,H})  R_{snow}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,E} = z_{0,E} + ( z_{0,snow,E} - z_{0,E})  R_{snow}
\end{eqnarray}

where, \(r_{0,snow,*}\) is the roughness of snow ice for momentum, heat
and vapor, respectively.

Third, let us consider the conductivity of ice.

When sea ice exists (\(L=1\)), the thermal conductivity
\(k_{ice}^\star\) of sea ice is obtained by

\begin{eqnarray}
k_{ice}^\star = \frac{D_{f,ice}}{\mathrm{max}(R_{ice}/\sigma_{ice}, \epsilon)}
\end{eqnarray}

where \(D_{f,ice}\) is the thermal diffusivity of sea ice, and
\(\sigma_{ice}\) sea ice density, respectively.

The calculated thermal conductivity is modified to \(k_{ice}\) to take
into account that it varies with snow cover.

\begin{eqnarray}
h_{snow} = \mathrm{min}(
    \mathrm{max}(
    R_{snow}/\sigma_{snow}),\epsilon
        ),h_{snow,max}
        )
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}      
k_{ice} = k_{ice}^\star (1-R_{ice}) + \frac{D_{ice}}{1+\| D_{ice}/D_{snow} \cdot h_{snow} \|} R_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

where \(h_{snow}\) is the snow depth, \(R_{snow}\) is the snow area
fraction, \(\sigma_{snow}\) is the snow density, \(h_{snow,max}\) is the
maximum snow depth, and \(D_{snow}\) is the thermal diffusivity of snow,
respectively.

Therefore, the heat conduction flux and its derivative are

\begin{eqnarray}
 G = k_{ice} (T_b - T_s)
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
 \frac{\partial G}{\partial T} = k_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

Note that in the ice-free region (\(L=2\))

\begin{eqnarray}
G=k_{ocn}
\end{eqnarray}

where \(k_{ocn}\) is the heat flux in the sea temperature layer, and
\(k_{ocn}\) is the heat flux in the sea temperature layer, respectively.

In \texttt{SUBROUTINE\ {[}SEAALB{]}} (of pgocn.F), the albedo for the
visible bands are calculated supposing ice-free conditions.

For sea surface level albedo \(\alpha_{L(d)}\), \(d=1,2\) represents
direct and scattered light, respectively.

Using the solar zenith angle at latitude \(\zeta\), the albedo for
direct light is presented by

\begin{eqnarray}
    \alpha_{L(1)} = e^{(C_3A^* + C_2) A^* +C_1}
\end{eqnarray}

where

\begin{eqnarray}
    A = \mathrm{min}(\mathrm{max}(\mathrm{cos}(\theta),0.03459),0.961)
\end{eqnarray}

On the other hand, the albedo for scattered light is uniformly set to a
constant parameter.

\begin{eqnarray}
    \alpha_{L(2)} = 0.06
\end{eqnarray}

In \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}SEAZ0F{]}} (of pgocn.F), the roughnesses of for
momentum, heat and vapor are calculated supposing the ice-free
conditions. calculated.

The roughness variation of the sea surface is determined by the friction
velocity \(u^\star\).

\begin{eqnarray}
u^{\star} = \sqrt{C_{M_0} ({u_a}^2  +{v_a}^2)}
\end{eqnarray}

where \(u_a,v_a\) are the zonal and vertical winds of the 1st layer of
the atmosphere.

We perform successive approximation calculation of \({C_{M_0}}\),
because \(F_u,F_v,F_\theta,F_q\) are required.

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,M} = z_{0,M_0} + z_{0,M_R} + \frac{z_{0,M_R} {u^\star }^2 }{g} + \frac{z_{0,M_S}\nu }{u^\star}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,H} = z_{0,H_0} + z_{0,H_R} + \frac{z_{0,H_R} {u^\star }^2 }{g} + \frac{z_{0,H_S}\nu }{u^\star}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    z_{0,E} = z_{0,E_0} + z_{0,E_R} + \frac{z_{0,E_R} {u^\star }^2 }{g} + \frac{z_{0,E_S}\nu }{u^\star}
\end{eqnarray}

where, \(\nu = 1.5 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{[m^2/s]}\) is the kinetic
viscosity of the atmosphere, \(z_{0,M},z_{0,H}\) and \(z_{0,E}\) are
surface roughness for momentum, heat, and vapor, \(z_{0,M_0},z_{0,H_0}\)
and \(z_{0,E_0}\) are base, and rough factor (\(z_{0,M_R},z_{0,M_R}\)
and \(z_{0,E_R}\)), and smooth factor (\(z_{0,M_S},z_{0,M_S}\) and
\(z_{0,E_S}\)), respectively.

\hypertarget{sea-surface-flux-sfcflx}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Sea Surface Flux
\texttt{{[}SFCFLX{]}}}{Sea Surface Flux {[}SFCFLX{]}}}\label{sea-surface-flux-sfcflx}}

The surface flux scheme evaluates the physical quantity fluxes between
the atmospheric surfaces due to turbulent transport in the boundary
layer. The main input are wind speed (\(u_a, v_a\)), temperature
(\(T_a\)), and specific humidity (\(q_s\)) from the 1st layer of the
atmosphere. The output are the vertical fluxes and the differential
values (for obtaining implicit solutions) of momentum, heat, and water
vapor.

Surface fluxes (\(F_u, F_v, F_\theta, F_q\)) are expressed using the
bulk coefficients (\(C_M, C_H, C_E\)) as follows

\begin{eqnarray}
    F_u  =  - \rho C_M |{\mathbf{v}}| u
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    F_v  =  - \rho C_M |{\mathbf{v}}| v
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    F_\theta  = \rho c_p C_H |{\mathbf{v}}| ( \theta_g - \theta )
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    F_q^P =  \rho C_E |{\mathbf{v}}| ( q_g - q_a )
\end{eqnarray}

Note that \(F_q^P\) is the possible evaporation flux.

The turbulent fluxes at the sea surface are solved by bulk formulae as
follows. Then, by solving the surface energy balance, the ground skin
temperature (\(T_s\)) is updated, and the surface flux values with
respect to those values are also updated. The solutions obtained here
are temporary values. In order to solve the energy balance by
linearizing with respect to \(T_s\), the differential with respect to
\(T_s\) of each flux is calculated beforehand.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Momentum flux
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray}
 \tau_x = - \rho C_{M}|V_a| u_a
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
 \tau_y = - \rho C_{M}|V_a| v_a
\end{eqnarray}

where \(\tau_x\) and \(\tau_y\) are the momentum fluxes (surface stress)
of the zonal and meridional directions, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Sensible heat flux
\end{itemize}

\begin{eqnarray}
 H_s = c_p \rho C_{Hs}|V_a| (T_s - (P_s/P_a)^{\kappa}T_a)

\hat{F}q^P_{1/2} = \rho_{1/2} C_E |{\mathbf{v}}_1| \left( q^\star(T_0) - q_1 \right)
\end{eqnarray}

\hypertarget{bulk-factor-blkcof}{%
\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Bulk factor
\texttt{{[}BLKCOF{]}}}{Bulk factor {[}BLKCOF{]}}}\label{bulk-factor-blkcof}}

In \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}BLKCOF{]}} (of psfcl.F), the bulk factors are
calculated. The bulk Richardson number (\(R_{iB}\)), which is used as a
benchmark for the stability between the atmospheric surfaces, is

\begin{eqnarray}
R_{iB} =
            \frac{ \frac{g}{\theta_s} (\theta_1 - \theta(z_0))/z_1 }
              { (u_1/z_1)^2                                  }
       = \frac{g}{\theta_s}
         \frac{T_1 (p_s/p_1)^\kappa - T_0 }{u_1^2/z_1} f_T
\end{eqnarray}

Here, \(g\) is the gravitational accerelation, \(\theta_s\)
(\(\Theta_0\) in MATSIRO description) is the basic potential
temperature, \(T_1\) is the atmospheric temperature of the 1st layer,
\(T_0\) is the surface skin temperature, \(p_s\) is the surface
pressure, \(p_1\) is the pressure of the 1st layer, $\kappa $ is the
Karman constant, and

\begin{eqnarray}
f_T = (\theta_1 - \theta(z_0))/(\theta_1 - \theta_0)
\end{eqnarray}

The bulk coefficients of \(C_M,C_H,C_E\) are calculated according to
\href{https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00117978.pdf}{Louis
(1979)} and
\href{https://www.ecmwf.int/en/elibrary/10845-short-history-pbl-parameterization-ecmwf}{Louis
{\emph{et al.}}(1982)}. However, corrections are made to take into
account the difference between momentum and heat roughness. If the
roughnesses for momentum, heat, and water vapor are set to
\(z_{0,M}, z_{0,H}, z_{0,E}\), respectively, the results are generally
\(z_{0,M} > z_{0,H}, z_{0,E}\), but the bulk coefficients for heat and
water vapor for the fluxes from the height of \(z_{0,M}\) are also set
to \(\widetilde{C_H}\), \(\widetilde{C_E}\), then corrected.

In \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}RADSFC{]}} (of pgsfc.F), the radiation flux at
sea surface is calculated. For the ground surface albedo
\(\alpha_{(d,b)}\), \(b=1,2\) represent the visible and near-infrared
wavelength bands, respectively. Also, \(d=1,2\) are direct and
scattered, respectively. For the downward shortwave radiation
\(SW^\downarrow\) and upward shortwave radiation \(SW^\uparrow\)
incident on the earth's surface, the direct and scattered light together
are

\begin{eqnarray}
    SW^\downarrow = SW^\downarrow_{(1,1)}+SW^\downarrow_{(1,2)}+SW^\downarrow_{(2,1)}+SW^\downarrow_{(2,2)} \\
SW^\uparrow = SW^\downarrow_{(1,1)}\cdot\alpha_{(1,1)}+SW^\downarrow_{(1,2)}\cdot\alpha_{(1,2)}+SW^\downarrow_{(2,1)}\cdot\alpha_{(2,1)}+SW^\downarrow_{(2,2)}\cdot\alpha_{(2,2)}

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Sea Surface Heat Balance

In \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}OCNSLV{]}} (of pgocn.F), the heat balance at
the sea surface is solved. Downward radiative fluxes are not directly
dependent on the condition of the sea surface, and their observed values
are simply specified to drive the model. Shotwave emission from the sea
surface is negligible, so the upward part of the shortwave radiative
flux is accounted for solely by reflection of the incoming downward
flux. Let \(\alpha _S\) be the sea surface albedo for shortwave
radiation. The upward shortwave radiative flux is represented by

\begin{eqnarray}
    SW^\uparrow = - \alpha_S SW^\downarrow
\end{eqnarray}

On the other hand, the upward longwave radiative flux has both
reflection of the incoming flux and emission from the sea surface. Let
\(\alpha\) be the sea surface albedo for longwave radiation and
\(\epsilon\) be emissivity of the sea surface relative to the black body
radiation. The upward shortwave radiative flux is represented by

\begin{eqnarray}
    LW^\uparrow = - \alpha LW^\downarrow + \epsilon \sigma T_s ^4
\end{eqnarray}

where \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and \(T_s\) is skin
temperature. If sea ice exists, snow or sea ice temperature is
considered by fractions. When radiative equilibrium is assumed,
emissivity becomes identical to co-albedo:

\begin{eqnarray}
    \epsilon = 1 - \alpha
\end{eqnarray}

The net surface flux is presented by

\begin{eqnarray}
    F^*=H + (1-\alpha)\sigma T_s^4 + \alpha LW^\uparrow - LW^\downarrow +SW^\uparrow - SW^\downarrow        
\end{eqnarray}

The heat flux into the sea surface is presented, with the surface heat
flux calculated in \texttt{SUBROUTINE:{[}SFCFLX{]}} (of psfcm.F).

\begin{eqnarray}
    G^* = G - F^*
\end{eqnarray}

Note that \(G^*\) is downward positive.

The temperature derivative term is

\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\partial G^*}{\partial T_s} = \frac{\partial G}{\partial T_s}+\frac{\partial H}{\partial T_s}+\frac{\partial R}{\partial T_s}
\end{eqnarray}

When the sea ice exists, the sublimation flux (\(l_s E\)) is considered

\begin{eqnarray}
    G_{ice} = G^* - l_s E
\end{eqnarray}

The temperature derivative term is

\begin{eqnarray}
    \frac{\partial G_{ice}}{\partial T_s}=\frac{\partial G^*}{\partial T_s} + l_s\frac{\partial E}{\partial T_s}
\end{eqnarray}

Finally, we can update the skin temperature with the sea ice
concentration with
\(\Delta T_s=G_{ice} ( \frac{\partial G_{ice}}{\partial T_s})^{-1}\)

\begin{eqnarray}
    T_s = T_s +R_{ice} \Delta T_s
\end{eqnarray}

Then, the sensible and latent heat flux on the sea ice is updated.

\begin{eqnarray}
    E_{ice} = E + \frac{\partial E}{\partial T_s}\Delta T_s
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    H_{ice} = H + \frac{\partial H}{\partial T_s}\Delta T_s
\end{eqnarray}

When the sea ice does not existed, otherwise, the evaporation flux is
added to the net flux.

\begin{eqnarray}
    G_{free}=F^* + l_cE
\end{eqnarray}

Finally each flux is updated.

For the sensible heat flux, the temperature change on the sea ice is
considered.

\begin{eqnarray}
    H=H+ R_{ice}  H_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

Then, the heat used for the temperature change is saved.

\begin{eqnarray}
    F = R_{ice} H_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

For the upward longwave radiative flux, the temperature change on the
sea ice is considered.

\begin{eqnarray}
    LW^\uparrow=LW^\uparrow +  4\frac{\sigma}{T_s}R_{ice}  \Delta T_s
\end{eqnarray}

For the surface heat flux, the sea ice concentration is considered.

\begin{eqnarray}
    G=(1-R_{ice})G_{free} + R_{ice}G_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

For the latent heat flux, the sea ice concentration is considered.

\begin{eqnarray}
    E=(1-R_{ice})E + R_{ice}E_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}

Each term above are saved as freshwater flux.

\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{free} = (1-R_{ice}) E
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{eqnarray}
    W_{ice} = R_{ice} E_{ice}
\end{eqnarray}
