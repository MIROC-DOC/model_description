\subsection{Definition of land-sea
distribution}\label{definition-of-land-sea-distribution}}

The land-sea distribution in MIROC is prioritized by the land-sea
distribution defined by the ocean model. While one grid in the ocean
model is defined by land or sea only, the land and ocean grids in the
atmospheric model are determined in proportion to the land and sea to be
consistent with the ocean model's land-sea distribution.

\(SA\) : area of the atmospheric grid, \(SL _ {ij}\) : area of the land
grid, \(SO _ {ij}\) : area of the sea surface grid, \(FLND^{atm}\),
\(FLND^{land} _ {ij}\), \(FLND^{oc} _ {ij}\) : percentage of land
surface is occupied by each grid. Then, following equation is satisfied.

\begin{eqnarray} SA*FLND^{atm} = \sum _ {j=1}^{jldiv}\sum _ {i=1}^{ildiv}(SL _ {ij}*FLND^{land} _ {ij}) = \sum _ {j=1}^{jodiv}\sum _ {i=1}^{iodiv}(SO _ {ij}*FLND^{oc } _{ij}) \end{eqnarray}

where, (ildiv,jldiv) is the number of east-west and north-south
divisions of the land surface grid, and (iodiv,jodiv) is the number of
east-west and north-south divisions of the sea surface grid. In the land
surface grid, if even a small amount of land is defined to exist,
boundary values such as land cover are required.
