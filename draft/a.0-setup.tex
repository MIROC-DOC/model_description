\subsection{Basic Settings}\label{basic-settings}}

Here we present the basic setup of the model.

\hypertarget{configuration-of-model-grid}{%
\subsubsection{Configuration of model
grid}\label{configuration-of-model-grid}}

The atmospheric and oceanic models of MIROC are independent and run on
different computational nodes. The node where the atmospheric model is
executed is called the atmospheric node, and the node where the ocean
model is executed is called the ocean node. In the atmospheric node, the
land surface model, sea surface model, and river model are executed as
sub-models. Information exchange between the atmosphere and the oceans
is performed through the sea surface model in the atmosphere node.
Information such as sea surface temperature and sea ice concentration of
the ocean model in the ocean node is converted to the grid of the sea
surface model so that it can be treated as a boundary condition of the
model in the atmosphere node. On the other hand, the heat, freshwater,
and momentum fluxes calculated on the grid of the sea surface model in
the atmospheric node are converted to the grid of the ocean model and
sent to the ocean node. These series of data communication and
conversion are done by the exchanger. The flux coupler stores data such
as boundary conditions, heat and freshwater fluxes calculated by the sea
surface model and land surface model, and distributes them to each model
as needed. In general, the flux coupler also includes the function of
the exchanger, but this document describes it separately.

\hypertarget{horizontal-grid-of-model}{%
\subsubsection{Horizontal grid of model}\label{horizontal-grid-of-model}}

The horizontal grid of MIROC is defined as the atmospheric grid, the
land grid, the river grid, and the sea surface grid for each model in
the atmospheric node. The sea surface grid in the atmospheric node is
different from the horizontal grid of the ocean model in the ocean node.
The land surface grid and the sea surface grid are the horizontal grid
of the atmospheric model divided equally into north-south and east-west
directions. The number of divisions can be set arbitrarily for each
grid. However, the number of divisions for the sea surface grid must be
divisible by the number of divisions for the land surface model. The
river grid can be the same as the atmospheric grid or an equal
latitude/longitude interval grid. The horizontal grid of the ocean model
uses horizontal general curvilinear Cartesian coordinates, so it is not
necessary to use the same coordinate system as the atmospheric model.
The exchange of data between the atmospheric model and the ocean model
is performed by using an exchanger, which is prepared in advance with
information on the location, number, area, and vector rotation of the
ocean grid that overlaps with the sea surface grid of the atmospheric
model.

\hypertarget{atmospheric-coordinate-system}{%
\subsubsection{Atmospheric coordinate System}\label{atmospheric-ccoordinate-system}}

The coordinate system of the atmospheric model consists of longitude \(\lambda\), latitude
\(\varphi\), and normalized pressure \(\eta\) (definitions are given
below), each of which is treated as orthogonal.
However, \(z\) is used
for the vertical coordinate in the ground, which is treated in a land physics component.

Longitude is discretized at equal intervals
(\texttt{SUBROUTINE:\ {[}SETLO{]}} in asetc.F).
\begin{eqnarray}
  \lambda_i = 2 \pi \frac{i-1}{I},  \;\;\; i = 1, \ldots I.
\end{eqnarray}

Latitude grids \(\varphi_j\) are derived from the
Gauss-Legendre integral formula (\texttt{SUBROUTINE:\ {[}SETLA{]}} in
asetc.F).
This is the zero point of the Legendre polynomial of order J
with \(\mu = \sin \varphi\) as the argument
(\texttt{SUBROUTINE:\ {[}GAUSS{]}} in uspst.F).
If J is large, we can approximate
\begin{eqnarray}
  \varphi_j =  \pi \left( \frac{1}{2}- \frac{j-1/2}{J} \right), \;\;\; j = 1, \ldots J.
\end{eqnarray}
Usually, the grid spacing of longitude and latitude is taken to be
approximately equal to \(J = I/2\), based on the triangular truncation of the spectral method.

Air pressure \(p\) is defined at half levels
(\(p_{k+1/2},\ k = 1, 2, \ldots K\)) using the following formula using
constants \(A_{k+1/2},\ B_{k+1/2}\):
\begin{eqnarray}
p_{k+1/2} = A_{k+1/2} +B_{k+1/2}\,p_s,
\end{eqnarray}
where \(A_{1/2}=A_{K+1/2}=0,\ B_{1/2}=1,\ B_{K+1/2}=0\) and thus
\(p_{1/2}=p_s,\ p_{K+1/2}=0\).
Therefore, the normalized pressure
\(\sigma\equiv p/p_s\) can be written as below:
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{k+1/2} = \frac{A_{k+1/2}}{p_s} +B_{k+1/2}.
\end{eqnarray}

Furthermore, a hybrid normalized pressure \(\eta\) is defined as below:
\begin{eqnarray}
\eta_{k+1/2} = \frac{A_{k+1/2}}{p_0} +B_{k+1/2},\ \ \ p_0\equiv 1000\ \mathrm{hPa}.
\end{eqnarray}

Since \(A_{k+1/2},\ B_{k+1/2}, p_0\) are constants, \(\eta_{k+1/2}\) is
also a constant and we use it as the vertical coordinate of the
atmopheric model.
However, as described in Chapter 2, basic equations
are descretized in such a way that \(\eta_{k+1/2}\) does not explicitly
appear and \(\sigma_{k+1/2}\) is used instead to commonize source codes
with the \(\sigma\)-coordinate system used in MIROC 5.

Air pressure \(p_k\) at full levels (\(p_k,\ k=1,2,\ldots K)\) is
interpolated from half-level pressure as below:
\begin{eqnarray}
 p_k = \left\{ \frac{1}{1+\kappa}
                     \left( \frac{  p^{\kappa +1}_{k-1/2}
                                  - p^{\kappa +1}_{k+1/2}      }
                                  { p_{k-1/2} - p_{k+1/2} }
                     \right)
              \right\}^{1/\kappa}.
\end{eqnarray}
Full-level pressure in a 80-level configuration is shown in Fig.
\ref{levels}. While lower layers follow the terrain, upper layers are
isobaric, and the two are smoothly connected.

\begin{figure}

\includegraphics{levels.pdf}
\caption{Default arangement of vertical levels for 80-level
simulations.\label{levels}}
\end{figure}

All prognostic variables are defined either on a grid of
\((\lambda_i, \varphi_j, \eta_k)\) or \((\lambda_i, \varphi_j, z_l)\).
(The underground level, \(z_l\), is described in the section on physical
processes.)

In the time direction, the forecast equations are discretized at
evenly spaced \(\Delta t\) and time integration is performed.
However, \(\Delta t\) may change in cases where the stability of the time integration is insufficient.
