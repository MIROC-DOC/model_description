# Radiation scheme in the MIROC 6.0
## Summary of radiation flux calculations [DTRN31]
The MIROC 6.0 radiation scheme was created based on the Discrete Ordinate Method and the k-distribution Method. The scheme calculates the value of the radiation flux at each level by considering the absorption, emission, and scattering processes of terrestrial and solar radiation by gases and clouds/aerosols.
