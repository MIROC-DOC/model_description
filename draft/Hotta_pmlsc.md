# pmlsc: Large Scale Condensation

## Physical basis for statistical PDF scheme

GCMs typically adopt fractional cloud cover to realistically represent clouds because of its coarse horizontal resolution ($O(100km)$). Statistical cloud schemes assume a subgrid‚Äêscale probability distribution function (PDF) of humidity within the grid to determine the cloud fraction and condensation. The key for statistical cloud schemes is to determine the PDF form and their moments. Assuming specific PDFs with their moments diagnosed or prognosed, integration of the PDFs will give the cloud fraction and condensate consistently.

The majority of statistical cloud schemes use the so-called "s-distribution", following Sommeria and Deardorff (1977). A single variable $s$, which considers the subgrid-scale perturbations of liquid temperature $T_l$ and total water mixing ratio $q_t$, is employed. $q_t$ is sum of water vapor and cloud water mixing ratio $q_c$.
$$
s=a_{L}\left(q_{t}^{\prime}-\alpha_{L} T_{l}^{\prime}\right)
$$
where
$$
a_{L}=1 /\left(1+L \alpha_{L} / c_{p}\right), \alpha_{L}=\partial q_{s} /\left.\partial T\right|_{T=\bar{T_l}}.
$$

By means of the "fast condensation" assumption,
$$
q_{c}=\left(q_{t}-q_{s}\right) \delta\left(q_{t}-q_{s}\right)
\tag{hpc.1}
$$
where $q_s$ denotes the saturation mixing ratio and $\delta(x)$ denotes the Heviside function of x.


The PDF of $s$ is denoted as $G(s)$. For any choice of $G(s)$, the grid-mean cloud fraction, $C$, and cloud water content, $q_c$, are obtained by integrating $G(s)$ and $(Qc + s)G(s)$, where $Qc$ denotes the grid-scale saturation deficit defined as
$$
Q_{c} \equiv a_{L}\left\{\bar{q}_{t}-q_{s}\left(\bar{T}_{l}, \bar{p}\right)\right\}.
$$
## Hybrid Prognostic Cloud (HPC) scheme

The statistical scheme implemented in MIROC6 is called Hybrid Prognostic Cloud (HPC) scheme (Watanabe et al. 2009). The HPC scheme proposes two types of shape for the PDF $G(s)$, Double-uniform PDF and Skewed-triangular PDF. We focus on Skewed-triangular because MIROC6 adoptes the shape. The physical basics of the scheme are in common with Double-uniform.

Example of the basis PDF for HPC: skewed-triangular functions.
Copied from Fig.1 in Watanabe et al. 2009.

The scheme preicts variance ($V$) and skewness ($S$) of the PDF. $V$, $S$, the second moment $\mu_2$, and the third moment $\mu_3$ are defined as follows.
$$
\mu_{2} \equiv V=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s^{2} G(s) d s
$$
$$
\mu_{3} \equiv \mu_{2}^{3 / 2} S=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} s^{3} G(s) d s
$$
$V$ and $S$ are affected by cumulus convection, cloud microphysics, turbulent mixing, and advection.

The the integrals to obtain $C$ and $q_c$ is symbolically expressed as
$$
C=I_{C}\left(\bar{p}, \bar{T}_{l}, \bar{q}_{t}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{S}\right)
\tag{W09-1}
$$
$$
\bar{q}_{c}=I_{q}\left(\bar{p}, \bar{T}_{l}, \bar{q}_{t}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{S}\right)
\tag{W09-2}
$$

where $\bar{p}$ denotes the pressure. The overbars denote the grid-mean quantity.

If the PDF is not too complicated, (1, 2) can be analytically solved for $V$ and $S$ by defining integrand functions, ${\tilde{I}}$ as

$$
\mathcal{V}=\tilde{I}_{\mathcal{V}} \left(\bar{p}, \bar{T}_{l}, \bar{{q}}_{v}, \bar{q}_{c}, C\right)
$$
$$
\mathcal{S}=\tilde{I}_{\mathcal{VS}} \left(\bar{p}, \bar{T}_{l}, \bar{{q}}_{v}, \bar{q}_{c}, C\right)
$$

The relationship between (1, 2) and (4, 5) is quasireversible. The double-uniform function and skewed-triangular function PDFs are selected for $G(s)$ because of their feasibility in deriving ${\tilde{I}}$.

## PDF change through processes

The cloud scheme is composed using prognostic equations for four
variables determining $I$, namely, $T_l$,$q_t$, $V$, and $S$. The prognostic variables can also be $T_l$, $q_t$, $C$, and $q_c$ that determine $\tilde {I}$.
Everytime after the processes that affects cloud water PDF take place in the model, $G(s)$ is updated.  Thus $G(s)$ is modified several times within a single time step.
### Cumulus convection

The total effect of cumulus convection to the PDF moments is written as

$$
\left.\frac{\Delta \mathcal{V}}{\Delta t}\right|_{\mathrm{conv} .}=M_{c} \frac{\partial \mathcal{V}}{\partial z}+\frac{\Delta \tilde{I}_{\mathcal{V}}}{\Delta t}
\tag{W09-14}
$$

$$
\left.\frac{\Delta \mathcal{S}}{\Delta t}\right|_{\mathrm{conv} .}=M_{c} \frac{\partial \mathcal{S}}{\partial z}+\frac{\Delta \tilde{I}_{\mathcal{S}}}{\Delta t}
\tag{W09-15}
$$

$M_c$ is the cumulus mass-flux including downdraft.
The vertical transport of the PDF moments is represented by the first terms on the right side hand of (14, 15).

Cumulus convections modify the grid-mean $T_l$,$q_t$, and $q_c$ by upward transportation in the convective tower and subsidence in the environment. Detrainment also change these variables. The detrainment of the cloudy air mass is included, as in Bushell et al.

$$
\left.\frac{\partial C}{\partial t}\right|_{\mathrm{conv} .}=D(1-C)
$$

The second terms on the right hand side of (14, 15) indicates the changes in the PDF moments consistent with the changes in the grid-scale temperature, humidity, cloud water, and cloud fraction.

$$
\Delta \tilde{I}_{\mathcal{X}}= \tilde{I}_{\mathcal{X}}\left(\bar{p}, \bar{T}_{l}+\Delta \bar{T}_{l}, \bar{q}_{v}+\Delta \bar{q}_{v}, \bar{q}_{c}+\Delta \bar{q}_{c}, C+\Delta C\right)
-\tilde{I}_{\mathcal{X}}\left(\bar{p}, \bar{T}_{l,} \bar{q}_{v}, \bar{q}_{c}, C\right)
$$

$$
\tag{W09-16}
$$
where $\mathcal{X}$ is either $\mathcal{V}$ or $\mathcal{S}$.

### Cloud Microphysics

The tendency due to microphysical processes can be written in a similar manner to the cumulus effect

$$
\left.\frac{\Delta \mathcal{V}}{\Delta t}\right|_{\text {micro. }}=\frac{\Delta \tilde{I}_{\mathcal{V}}}{\Delta t}
$$

$$
\left.\frac{\Delta \mathcal{S}}{\Delta t}\right|_{\text {micro. }}=\frac{\Delta \tilde{I}_{\mathcal{S}}}{\Delta t}
$$

Changes in $\bar{T}_{l}, \bar{q}_{v}, \text{and } \bar{q}_{c} $  are derived from microphysical tendency terms including precipitation, evaporation, melting/freezing.
### Turbulent mixing

From the definition of s , the PDF variance $V$ becomes
$$
\mathcal{V}=a_{L}^{2}\left(\overline{q_{t}^{\prime 2}}+\alpha_{L}^{2} \Pi \overline{\theta_{l}^{\prime 2}}-2 \alpha_{L} \Pi \overline{q_{t}^{\prime} \theta_{l}^{\prime}}\right)
$$

,where $\Pi$ is the Exner function. From the level-2 closure in by Nakanishi and Niino (2004), the time change of $V$ can be derived as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left.\frac{\Delta \mathcal{V}}{\Delta t}\right|_{\text {turb. }}=& 2 a_{L}^{2}\left[\left(\alpha_{L} \Pi\right)^{2} K_{H}\left(\frac{\partial \bar{\theta}_{l}}{\partial z}\right)^{2}+K_{q}\left(\frac{\partial \bar{q}_{t}}{\partial z}\right)^{2}\right.\\
&\left.-\alpha_{L} \Pi\left(K_{H}+K_{q}\right) \frac{\partial \bar{\theta}_{l}}{\partial z} \frac{\partial \bar{q}_{t}}{\partial z}\right]-\frac{2 q}{\Lambda_{2}} \mathcal{V},
\end{aligned}
$$
where $K_H$ and $K_q$ are the mixing coefficients for sensible
heat and moisture, respectively. $q^{2}=\overline{u^{\prime 2}+v^{\prime 2}+w^{\prime 2}}$ denotes the turbulent kinetic energy. The other symbols follow the original notation.
Since the turbulence production does not affect the PDF shape parameter defined by the third moment (cf. Tompkins 2002), the skewness change $\Delta \mathcal{S} /\left.\Delta t\right|_{\text {turb. }}$ is simply calculated due to the variance change in (28).

### Subgrid-scale horizontal eddy

In the planetary boundary layer, the subgrid-scale inhomogeneity is dissipated due to the turbulent mixing. In free atmosphere, the grid box will be homogenized mainly due to mesoscale motions, which are expressed by the Newtonian damping as in (Tompkins 2002): $\varepsilon_{\mathcal{V}}=\frac{\mathcal{V}}{\tau_{h}}, \varepsilon_{\mathcal{S}}=\frac{\mathcal{S}}{\tau_{h}}$
where the relaxation timescale is (as it represents the subgrid-scale eddy viscous diffusion) parameterized by the horizontal wind shear as
$$
\tau_{h}^{-1}=C_{s}^{2}\left\{\left(\frac{\partial \bar{u}}{\partial x}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\partial \bar{v}}{\partial y}\right)^{2}\right\}^{1 / 2}
$$
where the coefficient $C_{s}$ is set to 0.23 following (Tompkins 2002).
### Other physical processes

Radiation, mass source, and dissipation heating processes change the grid-mean temperature and humidity. Such effect is included in the same way as cloud microphysics.
## Equation solving procedures


The shape of the Skewed-triangular PDF is represented as follows. The widths defined by positions of the right and left edges on the s-coordinate are denoted as $a$ and $b$, respectively. The position of the top, denoted as $q$, is constrained by $a+b+q=0$. By definition, $q \leq b$ and $a \leq q$ must be satisfied. The PDF is then expressed as
$$
G(s)=\left\{\begin{array}{cl}-\frac{2(s-b)}{(b-q)(b-a)} & \text { for } q<s \leq b \\ \frac{2(s-a)}{(q-a)(b-a)} & \text { for } a<s \leq q\end{array}\right.
$$

The code in pmlsc file includes two main subroutines PDF2CLD and CLD2PDF. The subroutine PDF2CLD calculates $C$ and $\bar{q}_{c}$ from $\bar{p}, T_{l,} \bar{q}_{t}, \mathcal{V}, \mathcal{S}$. The subroutine CLD2PDF calculates $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{S}$ from $\bar{p}, T_{l,} \bar{q}_{t}, \bar{q}_{c}, C$. These subroutines are used to taken into account the physical process effects on the PDF as described in the previous subsection.
### PDF2CLD
#### From $\mu_{1}, \mu_{1}, \mu_{1}$ To $a,b,q$


The first, second, and third moments of the PDF is calculated as follows.

$$
\mu_{1}=\quad \int_{q-a}^{q+b}sG(s)ds \quad=q+\frac{b-a}{3}
\tag{E08-7}
$$

$$
\mu_{2}=\int_{q-a}^{q+b}\left(s-\mu_{1}\right)^{2} G(s)ds=\frac{a^{2}+a b+b^{2}}{18}
\tag{E08-8}
$$

$$
\mu_{3}=\int_{q-a}^{q+b}\left(s-\mu_{1}\right)^{3} G(s)ds=\frac{(b-a)\left(2 a^{2}+5 a b+2 b^{2}\right)}{270}
\tag{E08-9}
$$

From (7,8,9), we derive the solution for $a,b , q$ given $\mu_{1}, \mu_{2}, \mu_{3}$.

We define $\delta \equiv b-a, \beta \equiv a b$. (8,9) are

$$
\delta^{2}+3 \beta=18 \mu_{2}
$$

$$
\delta\left(\beta+12 \mu_{2}\right)=90 \mu_{3}
$$

Transform these equations to eliminate $\beta$ or $\delta$.

$$
\delta^{3}-54 \mu_{2} \delta+270 \mu_{3}=0
\tag{E08-10}
$$

$$
\beta=6 \mu_{2}-\frac{1}{3} \delta^{2}
\tag{E08-11}
$$

We apply the formula for the solution of a cubic equation to (10)obtain $\delta$.

$$
\delta=2 \sqrt{18 \mu_{2}} \cos \left(\frac{1}{3} \cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{-135 \mu_{3}}{\sqrt{\left(18 \mu_{2}\right)^{3}}}\right)+\frac{4}{3} \pi\right)
$$

$\beta$ is obtained from (11). Finally, $a,b,q$ is calculated as follows.

$$
\alpha=\sqrt{\delta^{2}+4 \beta}
$$

$$
a=(\alpha-\delta) / 2
$$

$$
b=(\alpha+\delta) / 2
$$

$$
q=\mu_{1}-\delta / 3
$$

,where $\alpha \equiv a+b$.

#### PDF to C and qc

Once the PDF $G(s)$ is defined by the parameters $a,b,q$, the cloud fraction $C$ and grid-mean cloud water mixing ratio $q_c$ are
$$
C=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \text { if } b<-Q_{c} \\
\frac{\left(Q_{c}+b\right)^{2}}{(b-q)(b-a)} & \text { if } q \leq-Q_{c} \leq b \\
\frac{\left(Q_{c}+a\right)^{2}}{(q-a)(b-a)} & \text { if } a \leq-Q_{c} \leq q \\
1 & \text { if }-Q_{c}<a
\end{array}\right.
\tag{E08-15}
$$

$$
\bar{q}_{c}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
0 & \text { if } b<-Q_{c} \\
\frac{1}{3} C\left(Q_{c}+b\right) & \text { if } q \leq-Q_{c} \leq b \\
Q_{c}-\frac{1}{3}(1-C)\left(Q_{c}+a\right) & \text { if } a \leq-Q_{c} \leq q \\
Q_{c} & \text { if }-Q_{c}<a
\end{array}\right.
\tag{E08-16}
$$

### CLD2PDF
#### From qc, C to a,b,q

1. When $a \leq-Q_{c} \leq q$

From (16), $a$ is
$$
a =\frac{3\left(Q_{c}-q_{c}\right)}{1-C}-Q_{c}
$$

Eliminate $q$ from (15) using $q = -a-b$, we obtain the quadratic equation of b.
$$
b^{2}+ab-2a^{2}+\left(Q_{c}+a\right)^{2} /(1-C)=0
$$

The physically meaningful solution for $b$ is
$$
b=\left(-a\sqrt{9 a^{2}-4\left(Q_{c}+a\right)^{2} /(1-C)}\right) / 2
$$

2. When $q \leq-Q_{c} \leq b$

From (16), $b$ is
$$
b=\frac{3 q_{c}}{C}-Q_{c}
$$

Eliminate $q$ from (15) using $q = -a-b$, we obtain the quadratic equation of a.
$$
a^{2}+ab-2 b^{2}+\left(Q_{c}+b\right)^{2} / C=0
$$

The physically meaningful solution for $a$ is
$$
a=\left(-b-\sqrt{9 b^{2}-4\left(Q_{c}+b\right)^{2} / C}\right) / 2
$$


#### From $a,b,q$ To the moments

By definition, the PDF moments are expressed in terms of $a$ and $b$.

$$
\mu_{2}=\frac{a^{2}+ab+b^{2}}{6}
$$

$$
\mu_{3}=\frac{-(a+b) ab}{10}
$$

## Adjustment of Cloud Fraction

When there is no physically meaningful solution for (18), $C$ is adjusted so that a reasonable solution is obtained. The critical conditions for the existence of real solutions for (18) are as follows.

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
9 a^{2}-4\left(Q_{c}+a\right)^{2} /(1-C)=0 & \left(a \leq-Q_{c} \leq q\right) \\
9 b^{2}-4\left(Q_{c}+b\right)^{2} / C=0 & \left(q \leq-Q_{c} \leq b\right)
\end{array}
$$

Eliminate $a$ and $b$ by (17),

$$
\begin{array}{ll}
9\left(\frac{3\left(Q_{c}-q_{c}\right)}{1-C}-Q_{c}\right)^{2}=\frac{4}{1-C}\left(\frac{3\left(Q_{c}-q_{c}\right)}{1-C}\right)^{2} & \left(A \leq-Q_{c} \leq Q\right) \\
9\left(\frac{3 q_{c}}{C}-Q_{c}\right)^{2}=\frac{4}{C}\left(\frac{3 q_{c}}{C}\right)^{2} & \left(Q \leq-Q_{c} \leq B\right)
\end{array}
$$

We define $R_{1}=1-\frac{q_{c}}{Q_{c}}, R_{2}=\frac{q_{c}}{Q_{c}}$,

$$
\gamma^{2}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
-4 R \sinh ^{2}\left(\frac{1}{3} \sinh ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{-R}}\right)\right) & (R<0) \\
4 R \cos ^{2}\left(\frac{1}{3} \cos ^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{R}}\right)+\frac{4}{3} \pi\right) & (R>1)
\end{array}\right.
$$

Note that, $\gamma=\gamma_{1}, R=R_{1}\left(a \leq-Q_{c} \leq q\right)$ or $\gamma=\gamma_{2}, R=R_{2}\left(q \leq-Q_{c} \leq b\right)$.

## Treatment of cloud ice and in-cloud water vapor

Because the original HPC scheme by Watanabe et al. (2009) does not consider the cloud ice, it is modified when coupled with the Wilson and Ballard (1999) ice microphysics. Since the statistical PDF scheme employs a ‚Äòfast condensation‚Äô assumption that is not valid for ice, the ice mixing ratio is conserved in the large scale condensation process by assuming that the cloud ice exists preferentially in a subgrid area having the largest amount of total condensate.

Here we assume that
- the water vapor mixing ratio within the cloudy area in a grid is constant
- cloud ice preferentially exists in areas with large total water content

Based on these two assumptions, the cloud fraction and each condensate mixing ratios are diagnosed in the following manner. The mixing ratios of liquid water $q_l$, ice $q_i$, vapor $q_v$, in-cloud vapor is $q_{vi}$ are employed.

At first the total condensate mixing ratio $q_c$ is diagnosed from $q_t$ and $T_l$ assuming that ice does not exist. The saturation mixing ratio is set for liquid ($q_{\text{satl}}$).
Mixed-phase cloud is generated when the condensate amount is more than the ice content, whereas the cloud fraction and vapor amount are adjusted in the case of a pure ice cloud when the condensate amount is less than the ice content. Specifically, $C$ and $q_{vi}$ is calculated as follows.

1. $q_c>q_i$

Liquid-phase clouds and ice clouds coexist.

$$
q_l= q_c-q_i
$$

$$
q_{vi} = q_{\text{satl}}
$$

2. $q_c<q_i$

Only ice clouds exist $(q_l=0)$. In this case, $C$ and $q_{vi}$ are rediagnosed. With the assumption that $q_c=q_i$, we eliminate $Q_c$ in (15,16) and $C$ is given as

$$
C^{3}=\frac{9 q_{i}^{2}}{(b-q)(b-q)} \left(q \leq-Q_{c} \leq b\right)
$$

$$
C^{3}+3 C^{2}=4-\frac{9\left(q_{i}+a\right)^{2}}{(q-a)(b-a)} \left(a \leq-Q_{c}<q\right)
$$

From these equations, $C$ is obtained as follows.

$$
C=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
\sqrt[3]{\frac{9 q_{i}^{2}}{(b-q)(b-a)}} & \left(0 \leq q_{i} \leq \frac{(b-q)^{2}}{3(b-a)}\right) \\
2 \cos \left(\frac{1}{3} \cos ^{-1}\left(1-\frac{9\left(q_{i}+a\right)^{2}}{2(q-a)(b-a)}\right)\right)-1 & \left(\frac{(b-q)^{2}}{3(b-a)}<q_{i} \leq-a\right)\\
1 & \left(-a<q_{i}\right)
\end{array}\right.
$$

,where

$$
Q_{c}=\frac{3 q_{i}}{C}-b=\sqrt[3]{3 q_{i}(b-q)(b-a)}-b.
$$

Given $Q_{c}$, $q_{v i}=q_{t}-Q_{c}$ is

$$
q_{v i}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
q_{t}-\frac{3 q_{i}}{C}+b & \left(0 \leq q_{i} \leq \frac{(b-q)^{2}}{3(b-a)}\right) \\
q_{t}-\frac{3\left(q_{i}+a\right)}{2+C}+a & \left(\frac{(b-q)^{2}}{3(b-a)}<q_{i} \leq-a\right) \\
q_{t}-q_{i} & \left(-a<q_{i}\right)
\end{array}\right.
$$
