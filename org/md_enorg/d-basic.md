TERM00006,TERM00006
is the horizontal diffusion term,
TERM00007,TERM00007
are forces due to small-scale kinetic processes (treated as 'physical processes'),
The TERM00008 is a process of 'physical processes' such as radiation, condensation, and small-scale kinetic processes
Heating and temperature changes,
The TERM00009 is a process that involves physical processes such as condensation and small-scale motion
It is a water vapor source term.
Also, the TERM00010 is a frictional heat,

     EQ=00004.

TERM00013 is ,
It is a time-varying term of TERM00014,TERM00014 due to horizontal and vertical diffusion.
