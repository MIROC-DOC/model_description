### Basic Equations.

The basic equation is ,
It is a system of primitive equations at the spherical (TERM00000,TERM00000) and TERM00001 coordinates,
It is given as follows ( Haltiner and Williams , 1980 ).

1. a series of expressions

    > EQ=00000.
    > <span id="mass" label="mass" label="mass">\\\\blur[mass]</span>

2. hydrostatic pressure formula

    > EQ=00001.
    > <span id="hydrostatic" label="hydrostatic" label="hydrostatic pressure">\blaze[hydrostatic pressure]</span>.

3. equation of motion

    > EQ=00002.
    > <span id="Vorticity" label="Vorticity" label="Vorticity">\\\\.00002}</span>

    > EQ=00003.
    > <span id="divergence" label="divergence">\\\[divergence]</span>

4. thermodynamic equation

    > <span id="Heat Power" label="Heat Power">\\blind\blind\blind\.com
    > EQ=00008.  
    > EQ=00008.

5. water vapor formula




    > EQ=00009.  
    > EQ=00009.

TERM00002,TERM00002
is the horizontal diffusion term,
TERM00003,TERM00003
are forces due to small-scale kinetic processes (treated as 'physical processes'),
The TERM00004 is a process of 'physical processes' such as radiation, condensation, and small-scale kinetic processes
Heating and temperature changes,
The TERM00005 is a system of 'physical processes' such as condensation and small-scale kinetic processes
The TERM00006 is a water vapor source term.
The TERM00006 is the frictional heat,

> EQ=00004.

TERM00007 is ,
The time-varying terms of TERM00008 and TERM00008 due to horizontal and vertical diffusion.

### Boundary conditions.

The boundary conditions for lead-direct current are

> EQ=00005.

. Thus, from ([\\0.25\0.25}(#mass)),
The time-varying surface pressure equation and
